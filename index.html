    <h2>About Julia</h2>
    <p>About Julia
Julia’s passion for hair began when she was eleven years old. Julia’s passion for hair began when she was just 11 years old. She still remembers watching in awe as a stylist created a fishtail braid — it was pure magic. Inspired, she went home brimming with excitement, asked her stepmom for a little help, and began braiding the hair of anyone with long locks she could find. After moving to the United States from Venezuela, Julia was eager to expand her skills. 

She’s spent years working alongside hairstylists with over 30 years of combined experience, learning to work with every type and texture of hair. Her friend helped her master the art of blow drying — especially for curly hair. Through that experience, Julia discovered her love for curls: how to celebrate them, enhance them, and tame them when needed. 

Living in Florida brought new opportunities and challenges. Julia took it upon herself to keep learning and growing, evolving into a confident, creative, and compassionate hairstylist and entrepreneur. If you’ve ever struggled to find someone who truly understands curly hair, Julia is your stylist. The Hobe Sound community has been a beautiful home for her blossoming business, and she welcomes every new client with warmth, care, and expertise — no matter your hair type or style.</p>
