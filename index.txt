About Julia
Julia’s passion for hair began when she was just eleven years old. She vividly remembers watching a stylist create a beautiful fishtail braid — and rushing home, eager to try it herself. With a little help from her stepmom, she began braiding anyone’s hair she could find.
After moving to the United States from Venezuela, Julia dove deeper into the craft. She learned from hairstylists with over thirty years of experience, working with every hair type imaginable. Her Dominican friend shared blow-drying techniques and a love for curls — how to honor them, define them, and tame them when desired.
Florida’s distinct climate and rules motivated Julia to keep learning and growing as a stylist. Since then, she has blossomed into an entrepreneur who brings warmth, experience, and artistry to every appointment.
Anyone searching for a true curly-hair expert — or simply a stylist who really listens — will feel at home with Julia. The Hobe Sound community has been wonderfully welcoming, and Julia can’t wait to meet you.
